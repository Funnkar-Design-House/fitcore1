## Current State

⚠️ **This project currently uses localStorage for data persistence** - data is managed through DataContext in `src/contexts/DataContext.tsx` and initialized from `src/data/mockData.ts`

- ✅ Full UI/UX implementation
- ✅ LocalStorage persistence (data survives refreshes)
- ✅ Complete CRUD operations for members and payments
- ✅ Supabase client configured
- ✅ Database schema defined
- ⏳ API integration pending (easy to migrate from localStorage to Supabase)

## Future Roadmap

- [ ] Connect Supabase backend
- [ ] Implement authentication
- [ ] Add real-time updates
- [ ] Generate reports and analytics
- [ ] Add payment gateway integration
- [ ] Implement email notifications
